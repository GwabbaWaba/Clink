# **Clink**
### Written for c++20 and zig 0.13.0
*Never try to write a game in Rust. I learned my lesson.*

Clink is a very early indev game about automation from the very ground up.
You will start from the bare basics of starting a fire with twigs, which will lead you into the expansive tech tree.
The automation will be a diverse set of challenges, making use of various mechanical, electrical, and pneumatic systems.

The game will be top down 2d with pixel art graphics.

The infastructure of the code will heavily lean towards mod compatability, with the base game tech tree using the modding interface.
